# Book Recommendation System using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Dataset
You can download the dataset from [here](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/books/book-crossings.zip).


## Overview

This project implements a book recommendation system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The goal is to provide users with personalized book recommendations based on their preferences and the similarity of books.

The recommendation system takes a user's input, such as their favorite books, and then utilizes KNN to find similar books from a dataset. The system ranks these similar books and suggests the top N recommendations to the user.

## Features

- User-friendly interface to input favorite books.
- Efficient KNN algorithm for finding similar books.
- Personalized recommendations based on user preferences.
- Data preprocessing to handle missing values and noise.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-recommendation-knn.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the recommendation system.
   ```
   python recommend_books.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input your favorite books and receive recommendations.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset of books and their attributes, including title, author, genre, and reader reviews. The dataset is preprocessed to ensure data quality and remove any irrelevant information.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate user feedback to improve recommendation accuracy.
- Implement collaborative filtering for more personalized results.
- Develop a web-based interface for a smoother user experience.
